# UPDATE
If you want something simple, un opinionated and scalable with no boilerplate: 
[React-Native-Query-Zusatnd-BoilerPlate](https://github.com/victorkvarghese/react-native-boilerplate-query-zustand)


## Scalability Factor

This Type based Architecture scales smoothly for small - medium apps. If you guys are building a very large application I would suggest using the following feature based architecture which will be more developer friendly with ease of scaling.
